Building a pipeline to process event data generated by a virtual music streaming site for music recommendation.

## Project Description

This project involves building a comprehensive data pipeline to reliably collect event logs generated by a virtual music streaming platform, preprocess and store the data, and provide the capability to visualize the stored data through a dashboard.



### System Architecture

1. **Data Collection (Orange):**

   - Fluentd collects four types of event data.
   - The collected data is sent to the Data Lake.

2. **Data Processing in Silver Phase (Blue):**

   - In this phase, raw data (Bronze Phase) is filtered and processed.
   - The processed data is stored in the Data Lake in Parquet format.

3. **Data Processing in Gold Phase (Yellow):**

   - Aggregations are performed on the Fact Table.
   - Fact Table is merged with relevant Dimension Table for advanced analysis.

4. **Data Loading and Visualization (Black):**

   - The final processed data is ingested from the Data Lake to Druid.
   - Data is visualized by connecting Druid with Superset.

### Data

[Eventsim](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) is a program designed to generate event data that simulates page requests for a fictional music website. The resulting data closely resembles real user interactions but is entirely synthetic. The Docker image for Eventsim is sourced from [viirya's fork](https://github.com/viirya/eventsim), which was originally used in the Streamify project [Streamify](https://github.com/ankurchavda/streamify).

Eventsim leverages song data from the [Million Songs Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com) to generate these events. I used a subset of 10,000 songs from the Million Songs Dataset as the basis for simulating user interactions.
